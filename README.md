# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

In this repository you'll find some jupyter notebooks that I create in order to train my Exploratory Data Analysis. All this datasetes I found on Kaggle. 

## What is Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA(**E**xploratory **D**ata **A**nalysis) consists in trying to have insights by analysing a dataset. It's that most common way to understand your data. EDA is the first step in
a machine learning project, where you have to analyse your dataset by finding the correlations between their columns and also to understand your data in order to choose the best 
algorithm approach. I also added some comments to each chart since this is a Exploratory Data Analysis I wanted to give you my view from what I was showing. 

Fun fact: In the Hotel dataset I had a guess about the Hotel's country with the analysis, later I confirmed by searching on the internet. 

## Libraries & Technologies

I choosed to program using python, and also a jupyer notebook, which is highly recommended in such cases. Basically, when you have a notebook you can separate your code 
in cells that gives you the opportunity to show some results. You'll see that I tried to use one cell for each chart that I made. The point was to give the attention needed to them

The Libraries used in this repository were mainly three: [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [plotly](https://plotly.com/). Of course
there was others such as: [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/). Pandas works like an excel with python, is one of the most used and I highly recommend
you to study it. Numpy is more numerical, to do the math, it's recommended as well but Pandas is a nice kickstart.

Regarding the charts libraries, I recommend to start with matplotlib, which is easier to understand, and then migrates to a more "professional" library such as seaborn. In fact,
you'll see that seaborn resembles matplotlib, especially when you're trying to personalize you chart. To me, plotly is the best simply because it can generate dynamic charts. 
Example: If you have a bar chart with 3 columns you can click in the name of one column to withdraw it from the view, and later bring it back. This gives you a huge flexibility during
a presentation. Unfortunately github does not support plotly libraries(I believe it's because to have this flexibility, plotly requires a javascript to run), so with you want to see
my analysis with this library you can click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lucasbatistafontes/eda-with-plotly/).
